On that Day the hypocrites, both men and women, shall say to the believers: “Look at us that we may extract some light from your light.” They will be told: “Go back and seek light for yourselves elsewhere.” Then a wall shall be erected between them with a door in it. On the inside of it there will be mercy, and on the outside of it there will be chastisement.
