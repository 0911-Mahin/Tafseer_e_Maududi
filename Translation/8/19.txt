(Tell the unbelievers:) 'If you have sought a judgement, then surely a judgement has come to you.  And if you desist from disobedience, it is all the better for you. But if you revert to your mischief, We will again chastise you; and your host, howsoever numerous, will never be of any avail to you. Know well, Allah is with the believers.'
