Wherever you might be, death will overtake you even though you be in massive towers. And when some good happens to them, they say: 'This is from Allah'; whereas when some misfortune befalls them, they say: 'This is because of you'. Say: 'All is from Allah.' What has happened to this people that they seem to understand nothing?
