Do you not see that it is Allah Who gently drives the clouds, then He joins them together and then turns them into a thick mass and thereafter you see rain-drops fall down from its midst? And then He sends down hail from the heaven - thanks to the mountains - and causes it to smite whom He wills and averts it from whom He wills. The flash of His lightning almost takes away the sight.
