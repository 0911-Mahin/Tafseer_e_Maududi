They will cry out in Hell and say: “Our Lord, let us out so that we may act righteously, different from what we did before.” (They will be told): “Did we not grant you an age long enough for anyone to take heed if he had wanted to take heed?Besides, there came a warner to you. So have a taste of the torment now. None may come to the help of the wrong-doers.”
