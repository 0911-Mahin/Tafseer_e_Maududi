They ask you about menstruation. Say: “It is a state of impurity; so keep away from women in the state of menstruation, and do not approach them until they are cleansed. And when they are cleansed, then come to them as Allah has commanded you.” Truly, Allah loves those who abstain from evil and keep themselves pure.
