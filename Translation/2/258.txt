Did you not consider the case of the person who remonstrated with Abraham about who was Abraham’s Lord just because Allah had granted him dominion? When Abraham said: “My Lord is He Who grants life and causes death,” he replied: “I grant life and I cause death.” Abraham said: “But surely Allah causes the sun to rise from the east; now you cause it to rise from the west.” Thereupon the denier of the Truth was confounded. Allah does not direct the wrong-doers to the Right Way.
