People question you concerning the phases of the moon. Say: “They are signs to determine time for the sake of people and for the Pilgrimage.” Also tell them: “True righteousness is not that you enter your houses from the back; righteousness lies in fearing Allah. So, enter your houses by their doors, and fear Allah that you might attain true success.”
