(You shall come to know that) when He will assemble you on the Day of Gathering. That shall be the Day (to determine) mutual gains and losses. Whoever believes in Allah and acts righteously, Allah will have his evil deeds expunged and will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Therein they shall abide forever. That is the supreme triumph.
