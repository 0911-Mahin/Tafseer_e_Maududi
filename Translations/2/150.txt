From wheresoever you come forth turn your faces towards the Holy Mosque, and wheresoever you may be, turn your faces towards it in Prayer so that none may have an argument against you, unless they be those immersed in wrong-doing. Do not fear them, but fear only Me so that I may complete My favour upon you; perhaps you will be guided to the Right Way.
