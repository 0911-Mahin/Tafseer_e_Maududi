They did not form any proper estimate of Allah when they said: 'Allah has not revealed anything to any man.' Ask them: 'The Book which Moses brought as a light and guidance for men and which you keep in bits and scraps, some of which you disclose while the rest you conceal, even though through it you were taught that which neither you nor your forefathers knew -who was it who revealed it?' Say: 'Allah!'- and then leave them to sport with their argumentation.
