What! Do they wait either for the angels to appear before them or for your Lord to come unto them or for some clear signs of your Lord1 to appear before them? When some clear signs of your Lord will appear, believing will be of no avail to anyone who did not believe before, or who earned no good deeds through his faith. Say: 'Wait on; we too are waiting.'
