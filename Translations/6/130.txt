(Then Allah will also ask them): 'O assembly of jinn and men! Did there not come to y ou Messengers from among yourselves, relating to you My signs, and warning you of the encounter of this your Day (of Judgement)?' They will say: 'Yes, we bear witness against ourselves.' They have been deluded by the life of this world, and they will bear witness against themselves that they had disbelieved.
