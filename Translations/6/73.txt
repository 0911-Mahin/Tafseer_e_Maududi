And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in truth; and the very day He will say: "Be!" (resurrection) there will be. His word is the Truth and His will be the dominion on the day when the-Trumpet is blown. He knows all that lies beyond the reach of human perception as well as all that is visible to man; He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.'
